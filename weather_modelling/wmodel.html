  <h1>Applications of Computing in Weather Modelling</h1>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    Collecting data is the first part of predicting future weather. This is
    gathered by:
  </p>
  <ul type="circles">
    <li>Satellites</li>
    <li>Weather Stations</li>
    <li>Radar</li>
    <li>Remote Buoys</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The next step is optimising and processing the data. This is called data
    assimilation. It is required because of the large volumes of global data
    collected. Machine learning is then used to create models of weather
    patterns, and neural networks are used to predict weather in advance.

    Weather maps are created, and these allow for local weather to be fitted
    into a larger weather system. These models can help to predict extreme
    weather events, which allow for preparation for hurricanes, tornadoes,
    snowstorms and more. This means that authorities can call for evacuations or
    put protection in place to prevent damage or loss of life.
