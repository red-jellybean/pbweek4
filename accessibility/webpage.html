    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Computer accessibility is the hardware and software that aids people when interacting with computing technology. For those who are partially sighted or blind this can help greating when using a computer. It can also be used for those who have less dexterity.</p>

    <h2>Operating Systems</h2>
    <p>Many operating systems such as Apple MacOS have built in features specifically for accessibility. These features can be found on all sort of devices such as mobile phones, laptops or even desktops</p>
    <p>Specialist software can also be used to for futher functionality</p>

    <h2>Features for Visual Impairment</h2>

    <dl>
        <p>Some of the ways content is made more accessible are:</p>
        <dt>Screen Readers</dt>
        <dd>this narrates the text on scrren </dd>

        <dt>Magnification</dt>
        <dd>this increases the size of image and text</dd>

        <dt>Colour Change</dt>
        <dd>this modifies the colours on screen, increasing contrast or inverting it</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Features for Mobility Impairments</h2>

    <p>There are multiple ways that technology has been modified to be more accessible for those with mobility impairments. These can be centred around limitations with using keyboards with the goal of allowing the person to accomplish the their task</p>

    <p>These modifications can be separated into inputs and outputs</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Inputs
            <ul>
                <li>Key Guards</li>
                <li>One-handed Typing</li>
                <li>Sticky Keys</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Outputs
            <ul>
                <li>Printer Retrieval</li>
                <li>Electronic References</li>
                <li>On-Screen Help</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Features for Cognitive Impairments</h2>
    <img src="images/stressed-business-man-sitting-at-his-desk-panics-in-front-of-his-computer-HPRFR8.jpg" alt="Stressed Person on Computer" width="50%" height="50%">
    <p>For people struggling with mental health issues, such as <ul style="list-style-type: square;"> <li>difficulities sleeping or concentrating</li> <li>forgetulness</li> <li>loss of motivation or confidence</li></ul> technology can be used to make a positive impact on their lives</p>
    <ul type="none">
        <li>Organisation</li>
        <li>Focus</li>
        <li>Mood</li>
        <li>Motivation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are also Virtual Assistants such as Siri that take voice commands as inputs and complete the instructions given</p>

    <p>It is important that institutions, education providers, employers and healthcare providers include these technologies allowing people of all abilities to access content and interact with technology in the ways best suited to them</p>
